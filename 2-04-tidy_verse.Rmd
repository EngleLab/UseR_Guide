# (PART) Working with Data {-}

# Tidyverse

In this section you will learn how to work with data in R by using a collection of packages known as the **tidyverse**

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz){target="_blank"} has been the main contributor to developing the tidyverse.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/hadley.jpeg"))
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/tidyverse.png"))
```

Although you will be learning R in this tutorial, it might be more appropriate to say that you are learning the tidyverse.

The tidyverse consists of packages that are simple and intuitive to use and will take you from importing data (with **readr**), to transforming and manipulating data structures (with **dplyr** and **tidyr**), and to data visualization (with **ggplot2**).
