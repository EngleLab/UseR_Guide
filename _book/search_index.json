The Flanker task is one of the more involved tasks to score. Wow! Now you have completed your Data Analysis scripts to go from tidy raw data to scored data and finally a single merged data file that is all ready for Statistical Analysis! And you can control all this by running the code in the masterscript, or just sourcing the entire masterscript. We made it! We made it! Data Visualization. This is probably the coolest thing you will learn about in R "]
