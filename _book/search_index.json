["index.html", "EngleLab: useRguide Welcome", " EngleLab: useRguide Jason Tsukahara Welcome This is a guide on how to use R for common data procedures and analyses we conduct in the Attention and Working Memory Lab (EngleLab) at Georgia Tech. This guide is in no way a comprehensive guide on using R. A more comprehensive guide to working with data in R is provided in the popular R for Data Science. The first two sections of this guide are about basic R skills and working with data. The Analyze Data section will be the most useful for getting started quickly on using R in our lab. It will cover common steps for tidying raw data, scoring and cleaning data, and merging data. The last two sections cover Data Visualization (something that R is excellent at) and Statistical Analysis. "]
