# (PART) Getting Started in R {-}

# Installation

## Installing R

First you need to download the latest version of **R** from their website [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org){target="_blank"}

1. Select **CRAN** on the left, just under **Download**

2. Select the first option under 0-Cloud

3. Select the download option depending on your computer

4. Select the **base** installation (for Windows) or the **Latest Release** (for Mac)

5. Open and Run the installation file

## Installing R Studio

The easiest way to interact with R is through the R Studio environment. To do this you need to [install R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){target="_blank"}

1. Select the **Free** version of **R Studio Desktop**
2. Select the download option depending on your computer

## The R Studio Environemnt

Go ahead an open the RStudio application on your computer.

When you open a fresh session of RStudio there are 3 window panes open. The Console window, the Environment window, and the Files window. Go ahead and navigate to File -> New File -> R Script. You should now see something similar to the image below

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/rstudio-environment.png"))
```

There are 4 window panes and each one has it's own set of tabs associated with it:

* The **Console** window (the bottom left window pane) is where code is executed and output is displayed.

* The **Source** window (the top left window pane) is where you will write your code to create a script file. When you open a new script file you will see a blank sheet where you can start writing the script. When you execute lines of code from here you will see it being executed in the Console window.

   The Source window is also where you can view data frames you have just imported or created. In the image above, notice the different tabs in the Source window. There are two "Untitled" script files open and one data frame called 'data'. 

* The **Environment** window (top right window pane) is where you can see any data frames, variables, or functions you have created. Go ahead and type the following in your Console window and hit enter.

```{r eval=FALSE}
hello <- "hello"
```

   You should now see the object `hello` in the Environment window pane

* The **Files** window (the bottom right window pane) is where you can see your computerâ€™s directories, plots you create, manage packages, and see help documentation.

## R Studio Settings

There are a few changes to R Studio settings I suggest you make. I will not go into why these are a good idea - so just do what I say! If you want to know you can talk to me about it.

Navigate to Tools -> Global Options

Change the settings to look like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, dpi = 50}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/rstudio-settings.png"))
```

Be sure to set 'Save workspace to .RData on exit' to Never

You can also change the "Editor Theme" if you navigate to the "Appearance" tab in Settings. Dark themes are easier on the eyes. I use **Material** dark theme.
