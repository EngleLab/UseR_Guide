In the Data Preparation stage, every R script that you write will require you to import a data file and output a new data file.

In this Chapter you will learn how to import and output comma-separate value (csv), tab-delimited, and SPSS data files.

For most of these data types we can use the `readr` package.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=125, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/readr_logo.png"))
```

The `readr` package contains useful functions for importing and outputing data files. 

Go ahead and install the `readr` package. In the console type:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
```

We will also use the `foreign` and `haven` packages for SPSS data files

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("foreign")
install.packages("haven")
```

We will use some example data files for this chapter. Go ahead and download these files. You will have to unzip the file. For now just unzip it in your **downloads folder**. Inside the unzipped folder you will see a number of data files in different file formats.

## CSV

`csv` files are by far the easiest files to import into R and most software programs. For this reason, I suggest any time you want to save/output a data file to your computer, do it in `csv` format. 

### Import `.csv`

We can import `csv` files using `read_csv()` from the `readr` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
read_csv("filepath/datafile.csv")
```

You can see this is very simple. We just need to specify a file path to the data. We will talk more about file paths later but for now we will use `absolute` file paths.

First, figure out the `absolute` file path to your downloads folder (or wherever the unzipped data folder is located). On Windows the `absolute` file path will usually start from the `C:/` drive. On Macs, it starts from `~/`

Import the `Flanker_Scores.csv` file. You might have something that looks like

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_csv("~/Downloads/Flanker_Scores.csv")
```

However, this just printed the output of `read_csv()` to the console. To actually import this file into R, we need to assign it to an object in our `Environment`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
import_csv <- read_csv("~/Downloads/Flanker_Scores.csv")
```

You can name the object whatever you like. I named it `import_csv`. 

To view the dataframe

```{r eval = FALSE}
View(import_csv)
```

### Output `.csv`

We can output a `csv` file using `write_csv()` from the `readr` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(object, "filepath/filename.csv")
```

Let's output the object `import_csv` to a `csv` file named: `new_Flanker_Scores.csv` to the downloads folder

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(import_csv, "~/Downloads/new_Flanker_Scores.csv")
```

Note that whenever writeing (outputing) a file to our computer there is no need to assign the output to an object.

## Tab-Delimited

`tab-delimited` files are a little more tedious to import just because they require specifying more arguments. Which means you have to memorize more to import `tab-delimited` files.

### Import `.txt`

To import a `tab-delimited` file we can use `read_delim()` from the `readr` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
read_delim("filepath/filename.txt", delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

There are three additional arguments we have to specify: `delim`, `escape_double`, and `trim_ws`. The notation for `tab-delimted` files is `"\t"`. 

Let's import the `Flanker_raw.txt` file

```{r eval=FALSE}
import_tab <- read_delim("~/Downloads/Flanker_raw.txt", "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

View the `import_tab` object

### Output `.txt`

We can output a `tab-delimited` file using `write_delim()` from the `readr` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_delim(object, path = "filepath/filename.txt", delim = "\t")
```

Output the `import_tab` object to a file named: `new_Flanker_raw.txt`

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_delim(import_tab, path = "~/Downloads/Flanker_raw.txt", delim = "\t")
```


## SPSS

As horrible as it might sound, there might be occassions where we need to import an SPSS data file. And worse, we might need to output an SPSS data file!

I will suggest to use different packages for importing and outputing spss files.

### Import `.sav`

To import an SPSS data file we can use `read.spss()` from the `foreign` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(foreign)
read.spss("filepath/filename.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE, use.value.labels = TRUE)
```

The `use.value.labels` argument allows us to import the value labels from an SPSS file.

Import and View the `sav` file `CH9 Salary Ex04.sav`

```{r eval=FALSE}
import_sav <- read.spss("~/Downloads/CH9 Salary Ex04.sav")
```

### Output `.sav`

To output an SPSS data file we can use `write_sav()` from the `haven` packge.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(haven)
write_sav(object, "filepath/filename.sav")
```

Go ahead and output the `import_sav` object to a file: `new_CH9 Salary Ex04.sav`

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_sav(import_sav, "~/Downloads/new_CH9 Salary Ex04.sav")
```

## RStudio Import GUI

The nice thing about R Studio is that there is also a GUI for importing data files.

When you are having difficulty importing a file correctly or unsure of the file format you can use the RStudio Import GUI.

In the **Environment** window click on **"Import Dataset"**. You will see several options available, these options all rely on different packages. Select whatever data type you want to import

You will see a data import window open up that looks like this

```{r echo=FALSE, dpi = 50}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/rstudioGUI-readr.png"))
```

Select "Browse" on the top right and select the data file you want to import.

The "Data Preview" window will let you see if it is importing it in the right format. You can change the import options below this.

You might want to change the "Name" but you can always do this later in the R Script.

Make sure all the settings are correct by assessing the "Data Preview" window. Does the dataframe look as you would expect it to?

Finally, copy and paste the code you need in the "Code Preview" box at the bottom right. You might not always need the `library(readr)` or `View(data)` lines.

Rather than selecting "Import" I suggest just closing out of the window and pasting the code into your R script.

`csv` files have a nice feauture in that RStudio knows that these are file types we might want to import. So instead of navigating through the `Import Dataset` GUI we can just click on the file in the `Files` window pane.

## Merging Data Files

You might find yourself in a situation where you need to merge multiple files together. There are two types of merge operations that can be performed. 

* In R, a "join" is merging dataframes together that have at least some rows in common (e.g. Same Subject IDs) and have at least one column that is different. The rows that are common serve as the reference for how to "join" the dataframes together. 

* In R, a "bind" is combining datarames together by staking either the rows or columns. It is unlikely that we you will need to do a column bind so we can skip that. A row "bind" takes dataframes that have the same columns but different rows. This will happen if you have separate data files for each subject from the same task. Each subject data file will have their unique rows (subject by trial level data) but they will all have the same columns. 

The E-Merge software program is performing a row "bind" of each subject .edat file. For E-Prime data we have to go through the E-Merge software program to bind individual subject files. However, you might have individual subject data files not from E-Prime that you need to merge. Or you may want to merge data files from multiple tasks into one big merged file.

My `datawrangling` package contains two functions to merge data files together:

* `files_join()`

* `files_bind()`

They both work in a similar way. The files you want to merge need to be in the same folder on your computer. You specify the location of this folder using the `path = ` argument. You need to specify a pattern that uniquely identifies the files you want to merge (e.g. ".txt", or "Flanker") using the `pattern = ` argument. Then specify the directory and filename you want to save the merge file to using the `output.file = ` argument.

Here are the arguments that can be specified:

* __path__: Folder location of files to be merged

* __pattern__: Pattern to identify files to be merged

* __delim__: Delimiter used in files.

* __output.delim__: Delimiter to be used in output file. Default is `,` (`csv`)

* __na__: How are missing values defined in files to be merged. Default is `NA`

* __output.file__: File name and path to be saved to.

* __id__: Subject ID column name. **ONLY for `files_join()`**

For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(datawrangling)
files_bind("filepath/data/subj", pattern = "Flanker", delim = "\t", output.file = "filepath/data/filename_merged.csv")
```

This will bind any files in the directory `filepath/data/subj` that contain the string `"Flanker"` and output the mergeed data to a file called `filename_merged.csv` to the directory `filepath/data`.
