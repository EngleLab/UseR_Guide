```

In this Section, you cleaned and scored data from the Flanker task. There were a lot of steps involved to do so. You calculated the **Flanker Effect** in addition to **FlankerBin** scores. You also performed data cleaning procedures to get rid of bad trials and subjects. The Flanker task is one of the more involved tasks to score. 

Wow! Now you have completed your *Data Analysis* scripts to go from *tidy* raw data to *scored* data and finally a single *merged* data file that is all ready for *Statistical Analysis*! And you can control all this by running the code in the masterscript, or just sourcing the entire masterscript.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/workflow.png"))
