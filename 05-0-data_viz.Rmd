## R Markdown

```{r include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/workflows/workflow_all.png"))
```

Phew! You've made it this far, good job. Up until now you have been learning how to do data preparation steps in R. Now for the fun part, statistical analyses and data visualization!

This is the third and final step in the data workflow process depicted above. Traditionally you have likely done these analyses in SPSS or EQS and have created figures in Excel or PowerPoint. The rest of the guide will cover how to do these steps in R.

Writing scripts to do statistical analyses is an entirely different process than writing scripts for data preparation. Therefore, we should first go over the general process of conducting and outputting statistical analyses in R.

In programs like SPSS when you run a statistical analysis, it will be outputted to a viewable `.spv` document. One downfall of this is that `.spv` files are propriety format so can only be opened if you have SPSS installed. However, there is the option to export a `.spv` file as a `PDF`. 

One downfall about R is that unlike SPSS, there is not a native way to create output documents from statistical analyses. Fortunately, RStudio has an output document format called **R Markdown**. 

### What is an R Markdown File?

**R Markdown** is a powerful way to create reports of statistical analyses. Reports can be outputted in a lot of different formats; html, Microsoft Word, PDF, presentation slides, and more. In fact, this guide was created using **R Markdown**. 

The easiest format to output as is **html**. html documents are opened in a web browser and therefore can be opened on any computer and device (phones, tablets, Windows, Mac). 

Follow this link for a brief Intro to [**R Markdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html){target="_blank"}

First, you need to install the `rmarkdown` package

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

To open an **R Markdown** document go to

File -> New File -> R Markdown...

Select HTML and click OK

An example R Markdown document will open. Go ahead and read the contents of the document. There are three types of content in an R Markdown document:

* A YAML header

* R code chunks

* Formatted text

### YAML header

The YAML header contains metadata about how the document should be rendered and the output format. It is located at the very top of the document and is surrounded by lines of three dashe,

```
---
title: "Title of document"
output: html_document
---
```

There are various metadata options you can specify, such as if you want to include a table of contents. To learn about a few of them see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html

### R code chunks

Unlike a typical R script file (.R), an R Markdown document (.Rmd) is a mixture of formatted text and R code chunks. Not everything in an R Markdown document is executed in the R console, only the R code chunks. 

To run chunks of R code you can click on the green "play" button on the top right of the R code chunk. Go ahead and do this for the three R code chunks in the R Markdown document you opened. (`cars` and `pressure` are just example data frames that come pre-loaded with R).

We have not gone over these functions yet, but you can see that the results of the R code are now displayed in the document. 

The first R code chunk is just setting some default options of how the output of R code chunks should be displayed. We will cover these options in more detail later.

### Formatted text

The formatted text sections are more than just adding comments to lines of code. You can write up descriptive reports, create bulletted or numbered lists, embed images or web links, create tables, and more. 

The text is formatted using a language known as **Markdown**, hence the name R Markdown. Markdown is a convenient and flexible way to format text. When a Markdown document is rendered into some output (such as html or PDF), the text will be formatted as specified by the Markdown syntax. 

In the R Markdown document you have open you can see some Markdown syntax. The pound signs ## at the beginning of a line are used to format headers. One # is a level one header, two ## is a level two header and so on. Also notice in the second paragraph, the word Knit is surrounded by two asterisks on each side. When this document is rendered, the word **Knit** will be **bold**. 

Go ahead and render the R Markdown document by clicking on the **Knit** button at the top of the window. Once it is done rendering you will see a new window pop up. This is the outputted html file. You can see how the document has formatted text based on the Markdown syntax.

There are a lot of guides on how to use Markdown syntax. I will not cover this so you should check them out on your own. Here is one I reference often: [**Markdown Cheatsheet**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet){target="_blank"}
