## R Markdown

```{r include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

This section will cover what RMarkdown documents are and how to use them. Coming Soon!

For a brief intro to **R Markdown** see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html

There are various metadata options you can specify, such as if you want to include a table of contents. To learn about a few of them see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html

There are a lot of guides on how to use Markdown syntax. I will not cover this so you should check them out on your own. One guide that I frequently reference is https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
