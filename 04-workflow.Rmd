# Workflow

The image below represents a general workflow I like to use when going from raw data files to statistical analyses.

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

1. The first step of the data processing workflow is to convert **"messy" raw data** files to **"tidy" raw data** files. The experiment software will produce a "messy" data file. In this file there are usually more rows and columns than you would ever be interested in, variable or values are named incoherently (i.e. stimSlide2.RT), or there may be separate files for each subject. It will be easier to work with a "tidy" raw data file. A "tidy" raw data file has only the rows and columns that are relevant (one row for each trial), variable and values are named coherently (i.e. RT), and there is one file that contains data for all subjects.

2. The next step is to **score the data**. For most statistical analyses you will want to aggregate the trial-level data into one or more dependent measures for that task. The scored data file will have one row per subject (or possibly one row per subject per experimental conditions).

These first two steps are all about **Data Preparation**. Getting your data prepared for your planned statistical analyses. These steps will be covered in Chapters 5 - 9.

3. Finally, you are now ready for the fun part, **statistical analyses** and **data visualization**. This involves evaluating the univariate descriptive statistics of your data set, running statistical tests, and creating tables and figures to interpret and present your results.

This third step of statistical analysis and data visualization will be covered in Chapters 10 - .

**Great! Now let's actually start working with some data in R**
