# Scatterplots

```{r include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

You can go ahead and set a default theme for your plots

```{r}
theme_set(theme_linedraw())
```


The main type of plots we typically want to create in psychological science are:

* Scatterplots

* Bar graphs

* Line graphs

* Histograms

## Scatterplots

We have already spent a good amount of time creating scatterplots using `stat_smooth()` and/or `geom_smooth()`. 

These two functions are essntially identical. In fact, many of the `geom_` functions are just wrappers around `stat_` functions.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/stat_func.png"))
```

The scatterplot we created from last chapter is essentially an interaction plot. The interaction of Species x Sepal.Length on Sepal.Width. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

For modelling an interaction effect in regression it is easier to interpret if the lines extend to all possible values - not just across the values within a group. 

We can do this by specifying the argument `geom_smooth(fullrange = TRUE)`

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE)
```

Now what if the moderator was a continuous variable and not categorical like `Species`? We would want to set the `color` aesthetic to be on +/- 1 SD on the mean. How would we go about doing this?

*The answer is*: It would be very difficult to do so. This is where the function `plot_model()` from the `sjPlot` package comes in handy.

### Adding other geoms

There might be other `geoms` we want to add to a scatterplot. Let's add some summary statistics to the graph. Specifically, a horizontal dashed line representing the mean on Sepal.Width and a vertical dashed line representing the mean on Sepal.Length. To make it more simple let's only do this for `Species == "setosa"`.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

iris_means <- iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Width_mean = mean(Sepal.Width, na.rm = TRUE),
         Sepal.Length_mean = mean(Sepal.Length, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(iris_means, 
       aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = Sepal.Width_mean), 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red4") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = Sepal.Length_mean), 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "green4")
```
