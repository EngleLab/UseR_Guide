# `workflow` Package

I have made it __WAY TOO EASY__ for you to 

1) Set up an organized directory and R Project for a new Research Study

2) Download ready-made R-Script templates

To be able to do this, you will need to download my `workflow` package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dr-JT/workflow")
```

## Start a new research study

Using the `workflow` package you can easily steup a new research study (BEFORE DATA COLLECTION) with an organized directory and ready-made R Script files.

What this package will do is create a root study direcotry with an `.Rproj` file and the following default folders:

* `/R Scripts` : For R script files

* `/Data Files` : For Data files

* `/Data Files/Raw Data` : For "tidy" raw data files

* `/Data Files/Raw Data/E-Merge` : For "messy" raw data files

* `/Data Files/Scored Data` : For scored data files

* `/Results` : For outputed `.html` results files

* `/Tasks` : For task files (E-Run and E-studio) that will be used to run participants

* `/Documents` : For any related document files (e.g. Methods documents)

----

Navigate to __File -> New Project... -> New Directory 

And browse until you see the option: __Create a Research Study__

Click on that and you will some options you can specify:

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/create_researchstudy.png"))
```


### Directory

* __Directory Name__: This will be the name of the folder for the study

* __Create project as subdirecotry of__: Select Browse and choose where the folder (Directory Name) should be located.

### Additional Options

* __Type of Study__: You can choose either `standard` or `sem`. The `sem` option will download some extra ready-made analysis template scripts (`.Rmd`) that are useful for conducting SEM in R.

* __# of Sessions__: How many sessions will the study have? This will create folders in the `Tasks` directory for each session. For instance, if there will be 4 sessions it will create the the folders "Session 1", "Session 2", "Session 3", and "Session 4".

* __Additional Directories__: Do you want to add the additional directories?

    * `/Results/Figures` : For any image files related to analyses
    
    * `/Manuscript` : For drafts and final versions of the manuscript related to the study
    
    * `/Presentations` : For any presentations you give related to the study
    
* __Download Scripts__: Do you want to download the following scripts?

    * __Generic Scripts__: Generic `masterscript.R`, `_raw.R`, and `_score.R` script templates
    
    * __Gf Scripts__: `gf_raw.R` and `gf_score.R` scripts
    
    * __WMC Scripts__: `wmc_raw.R` and `wmc_score.R` scripts
    
    * __Attention Control Scripts__: `_raw.R` and `_score.R` scripts for the antisaccade, flankerDL, stroopDL, va4, and sact tasks.
    
    The Gf, WMC, and Attention Control scripts should be good-to-go. You likely will not even need to modify these.
    
    The Generic scripts are good if you have additional tasks you will want to create `_raw.R` and `_score.R` data files for.
    
## Download ready-made templates

If you have already started data collection or have created your study directory, but want to download some R script templates you can use the `workflow::template()` function.

### Generic Templates

To download ALL __generic__ templates

```{r eval=FALSE}
workflow::template(all = TRUE)
```

To download specific __generic__ templates specify `TRUE` for whichever templates you want to download.

```{r eval = FALSE}
workflow::template(masterscript = TRUE, rawscript = TRUE, scorescript = TRUE,
                   mergescript = TRUE, demographics = TRUE, sem = TRUE)
```

### Gf, WMC, and Attention Control Scripts

To download ready-to-go Gf, WMC, and Attention control scripts, just specify `TRUE` for whichever script you want to dowload.

```{r eval = FALSE}
workflow::template(gf = TRUE, wmc = TRUE, ac = TRUE)
```
