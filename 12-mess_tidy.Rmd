In this Chapter you will go over an example of how to write an R Script for **converting *messy* raw data files to *tidy* raw data files**.

## Setup

In the previous Chapters you should have downloaded the example Flanker data set, setup your directory organization, and created an RStudio Project. 

If you have not done so already, open RStudio by opening the *UseRGuide_DataCollection.Rproj* R Project file. 

In the folder **R Scripts/templates** open the file **0_taskname_raw.R** and save it as **0_flanker_raw.R** in the **R Scripts** folder.

If you do not see the template file **0_taskname_raw.R**, you can download it. Just type in the following line of code in the console

```{r eval = TRUE}
workflow::template(rawscript = TRUE)
```

----

In the script file take note of the import and output directories. 

Change `task <- "taskname"` to `task <- "Flanker"`

Just by looking at the Setup section of the script you should be able to tell that this script will import the file Data Files/Merged/**Flanker.txt** and output the file Data Files/**Flanker_raw.csv**.

Note: Typically you will have to create the **Flanker.txt** file by using E-Merge and exporting the *.emrg* file to a *.txt* file. I have performed this step for you already. 

----

## Import

Now it happens on occasion that the wrong subject number is entered in when an RA is starting up a task. This can result in duplicate Subject numbers in the E-Merge file. Luckily I have created a function to remove the duplicate subjects, and put their information (with session date and time) into a specific file. This file will be created in a new folder called "duplicates".

The function is `duplicates_remove()` from the `datawrangling` package on my GitHub.

It can be difficult to remember what arguments you need to include in a function. To see helpful documentation about a function you can type in the console

```{r eval = FALSE}
?duplicates_remove
```

First, to the Setup section add the line of code to load the `datawrangling` package.

```{r}
library(datawrangling)
```


To the import section add the following line of code with the pipe operator `%>%`

```{r}
#### Import ####
import <- read_delim(here(import.dir, import.file), 
                     "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE) %>%
  duplicates_remove(taskname = task, 
                    output.folder = here(output.dir, "duplicates"))
################
```

Execture the lines of code up to and including import. 

You will notice that there was a folder created called **duplicates** in the Data Files folder. Open the file contained in this folder, **Flanker_duplicates.csv**. These are duplicate subject numbers and must be taken care of. For the sake of this guide, however, we will not do anything with them now. Though, they have been removed from the data.

View the dataframe by typing in the console

```{r eval = FALSE}
View(import)
```

It is a mess, right? Here are some things you need to know about the *messy* raw data file. These are the columns and what type of values they contain:

**Subject**: Subject number

**Procedure[Trial]**: Procedure type (keep: TrialProc and PracTrialProc)

**PracTrialList.Sample**: Trial number for practice trials

**TrialList.Sample**: Trial number for real trials

**FlankerType**: condition for real and practice trials (Values are: congruent, incongruent, and neutral)

**PracSlideTarget.RT**: Reaction time for practice trials

**PracSlideTarget.ACC**: Accuracy for practice trials

**PracSlideTarget.RESP**: Response for practice trials ({LEFTARROW} = left and {RIGHTARROW} = right)

**SlideTarget.RT**: Reaction time for real trials

**SlideTarget.ACC**: Accuracy for real trials

**SlideTarget.RESP**: Response for real trials ({LEFTARROW} = left and {RIGHTARROW} = right)

**TargerDirection**: direction of the target arrow for practice trials

**TargetDirection**: direction of the target arrow for real trials

**SessionDate**: Date of session

**SessionTime**: Time of session

## Tidy raw data

After the import block of R code, the next block is where we actually *tidy* the *messy* raw data. This basically involves filtering rows, renaming columns, changing values in columns, and selecting columns. And accordingly you will use these `dplyr` functions to do so:

* `filter()`

* `rename()`

* `mutate()`

* `select()`


For a more detailed explanation on how these functions work, see **Chapter 5**.

### Filter

Filter only relevant rows. We want to keep only the rows that contain trials from the practice and real trials (rows from the Instruction procedure and End Screen are in the imported data).

```{r}
#### Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc")
#######################
```

The column names are contained in single ticks because the names contain the special characters `[ ]`. There are certain characters R does not like to use as variable names and one of them is square brackets.

This line of code is saying only include (filter) rows where `Procedure[Trial]` is equal to `TrialProc` or (`|`) `Procedure[Trial]` is equal to `PracTrialProc`.

### Rename Columns

Now the column specifying real vs practice trials is a little tedious to keep typing out since it requires the single quotes and brackets. To rename columns we can use `rename()` function in `dplyr`.

```{r}
#### Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc") %>%
  rename(TrialProc = `Procedure[Trial]`)
#######################
```

This line of code renames the column `Procedure[Trial]` to `TrialProc`.

### Change Values

We should change the values in `TrialProc`. 

```{r}
unique(data_raw$TrialProc)
```

Right now real trials have the value of `TrialProc`. The same name as the column, not good! And the "practice" trials have the value of `PractTrialProc`. Let's change these values simply to `real` and `practice`, respectively. 

We can use a combination of `mutate()` and `case_when()` to change these values.

```{r}
#### Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc") %>%
  rename(TrialProc = `Procedure[Trial]`) %>%
  mutate(TrialProc = case_when(TrialProc == "TrialProc" ~ "real",
                               TrialProc == "PracTrialProc" ~ "practice"))
#######################
```

`case_when()` is an alternative to an `ifelse()`. The second line of the `case_when()` might read something like: *when the value in the column <b style = "color: skyblue">TrialProc</b> is equal to "PracTrialProc" set (~) <b style = "color: indianred">TrialProc =</b> "practice"*.

Evaluate that this worked

```{r}
unique(data_raw$TrialProc)
```

Okay now let's move on to figuring out what other columns we want to keep and if we need to do any more computations on them.

We want to keep the columns that specify the following information

* Subject number
* TrialProc (real vs practice)
* Trial number 
* Condition (congruent vs incongruent)
* Reaction time
* Accuracy
* Response
* Target arrow direction (left or right)
* Session Date
* Session Time

This gets a little more tricky here because the information for some of these variables are in one column for practice trials and a different column for real trials. That means we need to merge the information from these two columns into one.

For instance the RT data for practice trials is contained in the column `PracSlideTarget.RT` and for real trials RT data is in `SlideTarget.RT`. 

We can again use `case_when()` here. We can create a new column labeled `RT`, that when the values in the column `TrialProc` is equal to "real" then set (~) `RT` = `SlideTarget.RT`. And when `TrialProc` is equal to "practice" then set (~) `RT` = `PracSlideTarget.RT`. 

```{r}
## Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc") %>%
  rename(TrialProc = `Procedure[Trial]`) %>%
  mutate(TrialProc = case_when(TrialProc == "TrialProc" ~ "real",
                               TrialProc == "PracTrialProc" ~ "practice"),
         RT = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RT,
                        TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RT,
                        TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)))
#####################
```

It is not required in this scenario, however just as an illustration I added a third argument to `case_when()`, `TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)`

Scenarios in which you cannot or do not need to specify all possible rows in a dataframe, you need to add an option to tell `case_when()` what to do for those rows. In this scenario, "real" and "practice" in the column `TrialProc` covers all possible rows in the dataframe. However, if this is not true, you need to add another argument

`TRUE ~` followed by the value or function that those rows should have. To add an extra layer of complexity, if you want those rows to have missing values `NA`, then you need to specify a typeof missing value. If the other values in the column are numerical then you should specify `as.numeric(NA)`. If the other values in the column are character strings then you should specify `as.character(NA)`.

We can do the same thing for trial, accuracy, response, and target arrow direction. Combining them all into one `mutate()` function

```{r}
## Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc") %>%
  rename(TrialProc = `Procedure[Trial]`) %>%
  mutate(TrialProc = case_when(TrialProc == "TrialProc" ~ "real",
                               TrialProc == "PracTrialProc" ~ "practice"),
         RT = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RT,
                        TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RT,
                        TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)),
         Trial = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ TrialList.Sample,
                           TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracTrialList.Sample),
         Accuracy = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.ACC,
                              TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.ACC),
         Response = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RESP,
                              TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RESP),
         TargetArrowDirection = 
           case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ TargetDirection,
                     TrialProc == "practice" ~ TargerDirection))
#####################
```

You might want to change the values in the Response and CorrectResponse columns to be more clear (left and right).

```{r}
## Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc") %>%
  rename(TrialProc = `Procedure[Trial]`) %>%
  mutate(TrialProc = case_when(TrialProc == "TrialProc" ~ "real",
                               TrialProc == "PracTrialProc" ~ "practice"),
         RT = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RT,
                        TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RT),
         Trial = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ TrialList.Sample,
                           TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracTrialList.Sample),
         Accuracy = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.ACC,
                              TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.ACC),
         TargetArrowDirection = 
           case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ TargetDirection,
                     TrialProc == "practice" ~ TargerDirection),
         Response = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RESP,
                              TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RESP),
         Response = case_when(Response == "z" ~ "left",
                              Response == "{/}" ~ "right"))

```

### Select Columns

The last thing to do is select only the columns we want to keep. Remember we want to only select columns with the following information

* Subject number
* Trial number 
* Condition
* Reaction time
* Accuracy
* Response
* Correct Response
* Target arrow direction
* Session Date
* Session Time

```{r}
## Tidy raw data ####
data_raw <- import %>%
  filter(`Procedure[Trial]`=="TrialProc" | 
           `Procedure[Trial]`=="PracTrialProc") %>%
  rename(TrialProc = `Procedure[Trial]`) %>%
  mutate(TrialProc = case_when(TrialProc == "TrialProc" ~ "real",
                               TrialProc == "PracTrialProc" ~ "practice"),
         RT = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RT,
                        TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RT),
         Trial = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ TrialList.Sample,
                           TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracTrialList.Sample),
         Accuracy = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.ACC,
                              TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.ACC),
         TargetArrowDirection = 
           case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ TargetDirection,
                     TrialProc == "practice" ~ TargerDirection),
         Response = case_when(TrialProc == "real" ~ SlideTarget.RESP,
                              TrialProc == "practice" ~ PracSlideTarget.RESP),
         Response = case_when(Response == "z" ~ "left",
                              Response == "{/}" ~ "right")) %>%
  select(Subject, TrialProc, Trial, Condition = FlankerType, 
         RT, Accuracy, Response, TargetArrowDirection, 
         SessionDate, SessionTime)

```

And that is it for the *Tidy raw data* block!

Compare the `import` and `data_raw` dataframes. How many columns does each one have? Rows? View each one, which one is easier to understand?

## Output

You do not need to change anything in the output block

```{r}
#### Output ####
write_csv(data_raw, here(output.dir, output.file))
################
```

That's it! 

********

Great! You have written an R script for Data Preparation, converting a *messy* raw data file to a *tidy* raw data file. 

## Masterscript

Finally, you should add a line of code to the masterscript that *sources* the file **0_flanker_raw.R**.

```{r eval = FALSE}
source(here("R Scripts", "0_flanker_raw.R"), echo = TRUE)
```


********

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
rm(list=ls())
