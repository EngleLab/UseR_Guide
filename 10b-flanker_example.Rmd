Why the Flanker task? Because we love the Flanker task! Not really, but it is a good task to illustrate most of the functions you will want to use for other tasks. 

Basically, in the Flanker task the subject responds to the direction of a centrally presented arrow. There are two types of trials, congruent and incongruent. On congruent trials, the arrows surrounding (flanking) the central arrow are in the same direction as the center arrow. In the incongruent condition, the arrows are facing the opposite direction. 

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/flanker_arrow.jpeg"))
```

Reaction time is slower on incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. The difference in Reaction Time is the dependent measure for this task, and we can call this score a `FlankerEffect`.

* Create the following directory in the *Data Collection* repository: **Tasks/Session 1/1. Flanker**

From the example data set you downloaded,

* Save the files in the **data** folder to: **Tasks/Session 1/1. Flanker/data**

* Save the files in the **Merged** folder to: **Data Files/Merged**

* Save the file **subjlist.csv** to: **Data Files/subj**
