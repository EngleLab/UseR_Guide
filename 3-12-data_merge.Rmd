It is easiest to start an R script from a template. You can download an R script template for creating a merged file `workflow::template(merge = TRUE)`

As with all the other script templates we have used there are 4 sections in the merge script:

1. Setup

    This is where any required packages are loaded and the import/output file directories and names are set
    
2. Import files

    This is where the multiple **\_Scores.csv** files are imported and merged
   
3. Select only important variables and create composite scores

    This is where we select only the variables (columns) that we want to use for statistical analysis. We can also rename the variables to be shorter and more concise - this can make statistical analysis easier. 
    
    This is also where we can create composite scores.
    
4. Output

    Finally we need to save the single merged data file.
    
## Set up

This is what the **Setup** section looks like. We need the `datawrangling` package for the `files_join()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#### Set up ####
## Load packages
library(here)
library(datawrangling) # for files_join()
library(dplyr)

## Set import/output directories
import_dir <- "Data Files/Scored Data"
output_dir <- "Data Files"
output_file <- "name_of_datafile.csv"
################
```

## Import

The `datawrangling::files_join()` function becomes very useful here. This function will import multiple files, that contain the string `"Scores"`, located in `import_dir` and merge them into a single data frame all in one line of code.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#### Import Files ####
data_import <- files_join(here(import_dir), pattern = "Scores", id = "Subject")
######################
```

## Select only important variables

We can simply use the `select()` function to keep only the variables we need for statistical analysis and also rename variables. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
#### Select only important variables ####
data_merge <- data_import %>%
  select()

## Create list of final subjects
subj.list <- select(data_merge, Subject)
#################################################################
```

Not shown here, but this would also be the place to create composite variables if needed using `datawrangling::composite()`. This function was explained in detail in Chapter 7.

If you want to exclude subjects that have too much missing data across certain tasks this would be the place to do it.

Finally, I think it is a good idea to create a data file that only contains one column - a list of subjects that have made it through to this stage of data cleaning and scoring.

## Output

The last thing to do is save `data_merge` and `subj.list`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
#### Output ####
write_csv(data_merge, here(output_dir, output_file))
write_csv(subj.list, here(output_dir, "subjlist_final.csv"))
################

rm(list=ls())
```

The organizational structure and workflow for data analysis is depcited here:

<br>
```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width='40%', fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/workflows/repository_dataanalysis.png"))
```
<br>

You start with only the **task_raw.csv** files located in **Data Files/Raw Data**, copied over from the *Data Collection* directory. 

The **1_task_score.R** scripts imports a **task_raw.csv** file and performs data cleaning and scoring to create a **task_Scores.csv** file located in **Data Files/Scored Data**.

The **2_merge.R** script merges all the **task_Scores.csv** files together into one **Merged_Data.csv** located in **Data Files**. This file is ready for statistical analysis, it will have all the variables you are interested in and univariate outliers removed.

The **3_Analysis.Rmd** is an *R Markdown* script document for conducting statistical analyses and data visualization on **Merged_Data.csv**. The output of this script document is an **Analysis.html** results output file located in **Results**


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```
