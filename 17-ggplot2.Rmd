# Introduction to ggplot2

```{r include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 125, fig.align='center', eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ggplot2.jpg"))
```

## Grammar of Graphics

We saw from the last chapter that the two main components in a grammar of graphics are:

1) Graphics = distinct *layers* of grammatical elements

2) Meaningful plots through aesthetic mappings

We also saw that the three essential elements are the data layer, aesthetics layer, and geometrics layer. In ggplot2 there are a total of 7 layers we can add to a plot

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_all.png"))
```

## Data layer

The Data Layer specifies the data being plotted.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center', eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_data.png"))
```

Let's see what this means more concretely with an example data set. A very popular data set used for teaching data science is the `iris` data set. In this data set various species of iris were measured on their sepal and petal length and width. 

This data set actually comes preloaded with R, so you can simply view it by typing in your console

```{r eval = FALSE}
View(iris)
```

```{r}
head(iris)
```

We can see that this data is in **wide** format. What type of graph we can visualize will depend on the format of the data set. On occassion, in order to visualize a certain pattern of the data will require you to change the formating of the data. 

Let's go ahead and start building our graphical elements in `ggplot2`. Load the `ggplot2` library. Then:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = iris)
```

You can see that we only have a blank square. This is becuase we have not added any other layers yet, we have only specified the data layer. 

## Aesthetic Layer

The next grammatical element is the aesthetic layer, or **aes** for short. This layer specifies how we want to *map* our data onto the scales of the plot

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_aes.png"))
```

The aesthetic layer *maps* variables in our data onto scales in our graphical visualization, such as the x and y coordinates. In `ggplot2` the aesthetic layer is specified using the `aes()` function. Let's create a plot of the relationship between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width, putting them on the x and y axis respectively.

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

You can see we went from a blank box to a graph with the variable and scales of Sepal.Length mapped onto the x-axis and Sepal.Width on the y-axis.

However, there is no data yet :(  What are we to do?

## Geometries Layer

The next *essential* element for data visualization is the geometries layer or **geom** layer for short. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_geom.png"))
```

Just to demonstrate to you that `ggplot2` is creating R graphic objects that you can modify and not just static images, let's assign the previous graph with data and aesthetics layers only onto an R object called `p`, for plot.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```

Now let's say we want to add the individual raw data points to create a scatterplot. To do this we can use the function `geom_point()`. This is a geom layer and the type of geom we want to add are points.

In `ggplot2` there is a special notation that is similar to the pipe operator `%>%` seen before. Except it is plus sign `+`

```{r}
p + geom_point()
```

And walla! Now we have a scatterplot of the relationship between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width. Cool.

If we look at the scatterplot it appears that there are at least two groups or clusters of points. These clusters might represent the different species of flowers, represented in the `Species` column. There are different ways we can visualize or separate this grouping structure.

First, we will consider how to plot these species in separate plots within the same visualization.

## Facets Layer

The facet layer allows you to create subplots within the same graphic object

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_facet.png"))
```

The previous three layers are the **essential** layers. The facet layer is not essential, however given your data you may find it helps you to explore or communicate your data.

Let's create facets of our scatterplot by `Species`

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

## Statistics Layer

The statistics layer allows you plot statistical values calculated from the data

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_stats.png"))
```

So far we have only plotted the raw data values. However, we may be interested in plotting some statistics or calculated values, such as a regression line, means, standard error bars, etc.

Let's add a regression line to the scatterplot. First without the facet layer then with the facet layer

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Coordinates Layer

The coordinate layer allows you to adjust the x and y coordinates

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_coord.png"))
```

You can adjust the min and max values, as well as the major ticks. This is more useful when you have separate graphs (non-faceted) and you want to plot them on the same scale for comparison.

This is actually a very important deisgn principle in data visualization. **If you want to compare two separate graphs, then they need to be on the same scale!!!**

```{r}
library(dplyr)
ggplot(filter(iris, Species == "setosa"), aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(filter(iris, Species == "versicolor"), aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
ggplot(filter(iris, Species == "setosa"), aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = seq(4, 8, by = 1), ylim = seq(2, 5, 1))
```

```{r}
ggplot(filter(iris, Species == "versicolor"), aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = seq(4, 8, by = 1), ylim = seq(2, 5, 1))
```

```{r}
ggplot(filter(iris, Species == "virginica"), aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = seq(4, 8, by = 1), ylim = seq(2, 5, 1))
```

* Just a note. I highly suggest not using `scale_x_continuous()` or `scale_y_continuous()` functions. The `coord_cartesian()` function is like zooming in and out of the plot area. The `scale_` functions actually change the shape of the data and statistics layers. If a data point falls outside of the `scale` limits then it will be removed from any statistical analyses (even if the individual data points are not plotted `geom_point()`)

## Themes Layer

The Themes Layer refers to all non-data ink. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_themes.png"))
```

You can change the labels of x or y axis, add a plot title, modify a legend title, add text anywhere on the plot, change the background color, axis lines, plot lines, etc. 

There are three types of elements within the Themes Layer; text, line, and rectangle. Together these three elements can control all the non-data ink in the graph. Underneath these three elements are sub-elements and this can be represented in a hierarchy such as:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/theme_elements.png"))
```

For instance, you can see that you can control the design of the text for the plot title and legend title `theme(title = element_text())` or individually with `theme(plot.title = element_text(), legend.title = element_text())`.

* Any text element can be modified with `element_text()`

* Any line element can be modified with `element_line()`

* Any rect element can be modified with `element_rect()`

You can then control different features such as the color, linetype, size, font family, etc.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/element_func.png"))
```

As an example let's change some theme elements to our facet plot. Let's change the axis value labels to **red** font and increase the **size**

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "red", size = 14))
```

Now let's only change the x-axis text and not the y-axis text.

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red", size = 14))
```

It is a good idea to have a consistent theme across all your graphs. And so you might want to just create a theme object that you can add to all your graphs.

```{r}
a_theme <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red", size = 14),
                 panel.grid = element_blank(),
                 panel.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"))

ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red", size = 14)) +
  a_theme
```

### Built-in Themes

For the most part you can probably avoid the `theme()` function by using built-in themes, unless there is a specific element you want to modify.

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red", size = 14)) +
  theme_linedraw()
```

You can also set a defeault theme for the rest of your ggplots at the top of your script. That way you do not have to keep on specifying the theme for evey ggplot.

```{r eval = FALSE}
theme_set(theme_linedraw())
```

Now you can create a ggplot with `theme_linedraw()` without specifying `theme_linedraw()` every single time.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Species) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

You can do a google search to easily find different types of theme templates. I personally like `theme_linedraw()`
