# Preface {-}

Welcome to the EngleLab R Tutorial and Guide!

R is becoming a popular tool for doing statistical analyses across many scientific disciplines. It has many advantages but there is a considerable learning curve. This guide is meant to help you become proficient in R and quickly learn standard data processing tasks that are common in the EngleLab.

There are more detailed tutorials and resources mentioned throughout this guide. If you want to become more proficient in R it is a good idea to go through those as well.

There are a lot of online forums where people have asked the same questions as you and someone has most likely provided an answer. I suggest taking advantage of Google to help you learn more about R.

## How to use this guide {-}

There are two general ways you might use this guide:

1. Going through each chapter step-by-step as a tutorial

2. Referencing the guide as you work on your own projects

    In this case, the "Search" function will be useful to you. You can find the search option at the top of this document.
    
For both (particularly for the 1st one), you will want to create a folder directory to save your scripts and data files used in the Guide.

__Section I: Getting Started in R__ will cover the baics and fundamentals of how to use R. The Chapter on _Intermediate R_ is optional and not required to continue with the rest of the tutorial

## Workflow {-}

The image below represents the general data processing steps required to go from raw data to visualization and statistical analyses. 

This R Guide will show you how to create R scripts for each of these stages; allowing you to fully reproduce your analyses from beginning to end. One of the major advantages to this is it allows you to easily go back and change how you process data at any one of these stages.

1. The first step of the data processing workflow is to convert **"messy" raw data** files to **"tidy" raw data** files. Most experiment softwares will produce a "messy" raw data file. In this file there are usually more rows and columns than you would ever be interested in, variable or values are named incoherently (i.e. stimSlide2.RT), and/or there may be separate files for each subject. It will be easier to work with a "tidy" raw data file. A "tidy" raw data file has only the rows and columns that are relevant (one row for each trial), variable and values are named coherently (i.e. RT), and there is one file that contains data for all subjects. This is an easy step to skip but it is highly recommended because it will make it easier 1) for your future self to come back and do some additional analyses/re-analyses and 2) for you to share your raw data with other researchers.

2. The next step is to **score and clean the data**. For most statistical analyses you will want to aggregate the trial-level data into one or more dependent measures for that task. The scored data file will have one row per subject (or possibly one row per subject per experimental condition). This step also involves any data cleaning procedures you might choose to perform, such as removing outliers.

These first two steps are all about data preparation. These steps will be covered in __Section II: Working with Data__.
    
3. Finally you are now ready for the fun part, **Data Analysis**! Data analysis consists of visualing your data and conducting statistical analyses. At this stage you will be generating output of your results in tables and figures.

This third step will be covered in two sections; __Section III: Data Visualization__ and __Section IV: Statistical Analyses__.
