# Welcome {-}

<img src="images/eagle.png" width="250" height="250" class="cover"/> This is a guide on how to use R for common data procedures and analyses we conduct in the Attention and Working Memory Lab (EngleLab) at Georgia Tech. This guide is in no way a comprehensive guide on using R. A more comprehensive guide to working with data in R is provided in the popular <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz" target="_blank">R for Data Science</a>. 

The first two sections of this guide are about basic R skills and working with data. The **Analyze Data** section will be the most useful for getting started quickly on using R in our lab. It will cover common steps for tidying raw data, scoring and cleaning data, and merging data. The last two sections cover **Data Visualization** (something that R is excellent at) and **Statistical Analysis**.
