# Fundamentals of Data Visualization

```{r include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

Data visualization is an essential skill for anyone working with data. It is a combination of statistical understanding and design principles. In this way, data visualization is about **graphical data analysis** and **communication and perception**.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/dataviz_general.png"))
```

Data visualization is often times glossed over in our stats courses. This is unfortunate because it is so important for better understanding our data, for communicating our results to others, and frankly it is too easy to create poorly designed visualizations. 

As a scientist, there are two purposes for visualizing our data. 

1) Data exploration: it is difficult to fully understand our data just by looking at numbers on a screen arranged in rows and columns. Being skilled in data visualization will help you better understand your data.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/matrix_code.jpg"))
```

2) Explain and Communicate: You will also need to explain and communicate your results to collegues or in scientific publications. 

The same data visualization principles apply to both purposes, however for communicating your results you may want to place more emphasis on aesthetics and readability. For data exploration your visualizations do not have to be pretty.

## Grammar of Graphics

Leland Wilkinson (Grammar of Graphics, 1999) formulized two main principles in his plotting framework:

1) Graphics = distinct *layers* of grammatical elements

2) Meaningful plots through aesthetic mappings

The essential grammatical elements to create any visualization are:

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ge_essentials.png"))
```

## Plotting Functions in R

It is possible to create plots in R using the base R function `plot()`. The neat thing about `plot()` is that it is really good at knowing what kind of plot you want without you having to specify. However, these are not easy to customize and the output is a static image not an R object that can be modified. 

To allow for data visualization that is more in line with the principles for a grammar of graphics, Hadley Wickham (pictured below) created the `ggplot2` package. This by far the most popular package for data visualization in R.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/hadley.jpeg"))
```
