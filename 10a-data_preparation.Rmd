In this section we will go over creating R scripts for the steps of *Data Preparation* using an example data set.

This part is not always fun and it can be very tempting to skip and go straight to creating a *scored* data file that is ready for data analysis.  However, I strongly advise against that. There are at least a few good reasons why:

1) Sometimes you actually NEED the raw trial level data. For instance, to do reliability or internal consistency analyses. 

2) Visualizing and analyzing trial-level data can help you better understand your data.

3) You or some other researcher might want to go back and run analyses starting from the trial-level data. Maybe you/they want to score the data slightly differently than you did before. 

4) Data storage. Storing and sharing your data in a *tidy* raw data format makes SO MUCH more sense than storing your *messy* raw data. If working with your *messy* raw data gives you a headache now imagine how much worse that is when you have not thought about that data for a long time.

And so many other reasons

----

There are **4 data preparation steps:**

1. **Organize the raw data files**. This involves moving the raw *.edat* files from *Tasks/Session #/#. Task/* to *Data Files/edat/Task/*.

2. **Merge** the individual *.edat* files into a single **task.emrg** file using *E-Merge*

3. **Export** the **task.emrg** file to a **task.txt** file so we can process the data in **R**

4. **Source** the **0_task_raw.R** *Scripts* 

    **0_task_raw.R** imports a *task.txt* file and creates a *tidy* raw data file, **task_raw.csv**

We will cover step 1 and step 4. See [Data Preparation Instructions]() for a detailed guide on how to perform the other steps. 

## Data Collection Repository

Create a new *Data Collection* Repository for this section of the tutorial

You will first have to install the `workflow` package. If you have not done so you can install it: `devtools::install_github("dr-JT/workflow")`. Then:

File --> New Project... --> New Directory --> Research Study

* __Directory Name__: UseRGuide_DataCollection

* __Create project as subdirectory of__: Your R_Tutorial directory

* __Repository Type__: data collection

* __# of Sessions__: 2

----

In the folder **UseRGuide_DataCollection** you should see an organization that looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width='30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/repository_datacollection.png"))
```

You will notice that there are already some template scripts so you can quickly start using R for **Data Preparation**.

**When working on this Data Preparation section you should open RStudio by opening the *UseRGuide_DataCollection.Rproj* file**.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```
