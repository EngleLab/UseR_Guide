By far the most common statistical analyses we do in this lab are confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). 

This Chapter will cover how to conduct CFA's and SEM's in R using the `lavaan` package.

## `lavaan`

Install the `lavaan` package

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lavaan")
```

Visit the [lavaan website](http://lavaan.ugent.be){target="_blank"} and navigate to the **Tutorial** tab. 

This is an excellent resource for you to consult if you forget any syntax or want more details on using *lavaan*. You should go over the full tutorial yourself, but I will go ahead and cover the basics here.

There are only two main steps to run a lavaan model.

1) Build the model object

2) Run the model with `cfa()` or `sem()`

### Building the model object

The model object is where you specify the model equation for the CFA or SEM. It is actually very easy and intuitive to do. Basically you specify the model equation within single quotes and pass it to an object called model. Let's say we have want to run a model corresponding to this model diagram:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/stats/cfa_example.png"))
```

We would simply specify:

```{r}
model <- ' 
visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3 
textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9 
'
```

This defines a CFA model with three latent factors; **visual**, **textual**, and **speed** with their respective indicators. The indicators need to correspond to column names in the data frame.

There are certain defaults that `lavaan` uses so that we do not have to specify every single path in the model. For instance, by default it will add correlations between the latent factors in a CFA model. That is why in the model example above, the latent correlations are not explicit, yet they are implicitly part of the model. 

**Model Syntax**

| formula type               |	operator | mnemonic            |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| latent variable definition |	=~       | is measured by      |
| regression                 |	~	       | is regressed on     |
| variance/covariance        |	~~       | is correlated with  |
| new parameter              |  :=       | is defined by       |


### Run the model

Then the model can be ran using `cfa()` or `sem()` functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit <- cfa(model, data)
```

The first two arguments to pass onto the lavaan functions are `model` and `data`, respectively. There are other important arguments that we will cover later.

The `summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)` output to a lavaan model looks like

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
library(semoutput)
library(semPlot)
library(sjPlot)
fit <- cfa(model, HolzingerSwineford1939)
summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
```

**Yikes!!**

You really should learn to understand this output, but nicer looking output would be nice right?

This is where my `semoutput` package comes in handy.

## `semoutput`

If you have not done so already open the RStudio project file for this tutorial.

</div>

----

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
data <- PoliticalDemocracy
```


Save it to the folder **Data Files** of your project directory.

Install `semoutput`

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dr-JT/semoutput")
```

Additional packages you will need to have installed

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sjPlot")
install.packages("semPlot")
```

Once you install `semoutput` you should Restart R by going to:

Session -> Restart R

You can download an R Markdown template for doing CFA and SEM in `lavaan`. Go to:

File -> New File -> R Markdown...From Template -> CFA/SEM (lavaan)

### YAML Header

At the top of the document is what is called the YAML header. Here is where you can specify certain parameters that you may want to use as default in your analyses.

You also need to specify the location and name of the data file you will be working with

```{r eval=FALSE}
params:
  import.file: ""       # Relative file path to data
  mimic: "lavaan"       # Which software program to mimic for estimating models
  missing: "ML"         # How to deal with missing values: "ML" or "listwise"
  std.lv: TRUE          # For CFAs, default setting whether to set latent variances to 1 or not
  std.ov: FALSE         # Standardize all observed varialbes?
  se: "standard"        # How to calcualte standard errors: "standard" or "bootstrap"
  bootstrap: 1000       # If se = "bootstrap" how many boostrap samples?
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
params <- list(import.file = "", mimic = "lavaan", missing = "ML", 
               std.lv = TRUE, std.ov = FALSE, se = "standard",
               bootstrap = 1000)
```


*skipping the efa example for now*

The first R code chunk **Required Packages** is where you should load any packages used in the document. 

The next R code chunk is where the data file is imported.

The next two R code chunk's print out a descriptive and correlational tables.

The next section is a template for conducting an exploratory factor analysis with `psych::fa()`. Let's skip this for now.

The next two sections are templates for CFA and SEM using `lavaan`. For each CFA and SEM section there are 4 subsections. 

- The “Summary Output” subsection displays nice looking tables summarizing the model results

- The “Diagram Output” subsection will display a model diagram

- The “Residual Correlation Matrix” subsection will display the residual correlation matrix

- The “Full Output” subsection will display the results from summary() along with parameter estimates and modification indices. This way you can still get the full output from a lavaan model as it provides more information than the “Summary Output”. You can also add additional output to this section if you need more info about the model.

### CFA Example

Ultimately we will run the following SEM model. First let's conduct a CFA of the model.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/stats/sem_example.png"))
```

The following error residuals are correlated:

y1 and y5; y2 and y4; y2 and y6; y3 and y7; y4 and y8; y6 and y8

To correlate error residuals you would specify:

```{}
y1 ~~ y5
```

Move down to the CFA section. First, you need to create a list of the latent factor labels (this is for the output and not running a `lavaan` model).

```{r}
factors <- c("dem60", "ind60", "dem65")
```

Then specify the model equation. The commented lines (e.g. # latent factors) are just optional and can be changed or removed. Remember, the factor correlations are implied.

```{r eval=FALSE}
model <- '
# latent factors

# correlated errors

# constraints

'
```

```{r}
model <- '
# latent factors
dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8

# correlated errors
y1 ~~ y5
y2 ~~ y4
y2 ~~ y6
y3 ~~ y7
y4 ~~ y8
y6 ~~ y8

# constraints

'
```

You do not need to change anything for `cfa()`. Unless you want to change some of the defaults you set in the YAML header.

```{r}
fit <- cfa(model = model, data = data, 
           mimic = params$mimic, missing = params$missing, 
           std.lv = params$std.lv, std.ov = params$std.ov,
           se = params$se, bootstrap = params$bootstrap)
```

Run this R code chunk by pressing the green arrow button. Then run each R code chunk in each subsection to print the output.

```{r}
sem_sig(fit)
sem_fitmeasures(fit)
sem_factorloadings(fit, standardized = TRUE, ci = "standardized")
sem_factorcor(fit, factors = factors)
sem_factorvar(fit, factors = factors)
sem_rsquared(fit)
```

```{r}
semPaths(fit, latents = factors, whatLabels = "std", layout = "tree2", 
         rotation = 2, style = "lisrel", optimizeLatRes = TRUE, 
         intercepts = FALSE, residuals = TRUE, curve = 1, curvature = 2, 
         sizeLat = 10, nCharNodes = 8, sizeMan = 11, sizeMan2 = 4, 
         edge.label.cex = 1.2, edge.color = "#000000")
```

```{r}
modificationIndices(fit, sort. = TRUE, minimum.value = 3)
```


### SEM Example

Now let's run the actual SEM model. Really the only difference is that we will add some regression paths

```{r}
factors <- c("dem60", "ind60", "dem65")
```

```{r}
model <- '
# latent factors
dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8

# variances

# covariances
y1 ~~ y5
y2 ~~ y4
y2 ~~ y6
y3 ~~ y7
y4 ~~ y8
y6 ~~ y8

# regressions
dem65 ~ dem60 + ind60
dem60 ~ ind60
'
```

```{r}
fit <- sem(model = model, data = data, 
           mimic = params$mimic, missing = params$missing, 
           std.lv = FALSE, std.ov = params$std.ov,
           se = params$se, bootstrap = params$bootstrap)
```

```{r}
sem_sig(fit)
sem_fitmeasures(fit)
sem_factorloadings(fit, standardized = TRUE, ci = "standardized")
sem_paths(fit, standardized = TRUE, ci = "standardized")
sem_factorcor(fit, factors = factors)
sem_factorvar(fit, factors = factors)
sem_rsquared(fit)
```

```{r}
semPaths(fit, latents = factors, whatLabels = "std", layout = "tree2", 
         rotation = 2, style = "lisrel", optimizeLatRes = TRUE, 
         intercepts = FALSE, residuals = TRUE, curve = 1, curvature = 2, 
         sizeLat = 10, nCharNodes = 8, sizeMan = 11, sizeMan2 = 4, 
         edge.label.cex = 1.2, edge.color = "#000000")
```
